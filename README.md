# hello-world
Following the "Hello World" tutorial. 
Well, at this point in the tutorial, I have been instructed to write a bit about myself. So, here you are:
I studied biology and chemistry at a small liberal arts college in Vermont called Green Mountain College, a school with an institutional focus on environmental issues. I loved studying immensely. I still do. Learning is my one true passion. But I quickly became a bit disillusioned with academic science and, after a very brief stint working as a research technician at a hospital in Boston, I decided to quit and do something that allowed me to be out and about all day. So, now I am working as a stone mason for a landscape construction company in Rhode Island. I enjoy it very much but I do not intend to do this for the rest of my life. I really enjoy problem-solving and mathematics (insofar as I understand the subject) and my small excursions into programming (on Code Academy) have  been incredibly fun. So, I'm on a quest to learn as much as I can about computer and data science in the hopes of eventually working in the world of computer science/data analysis/data visualization/anything that is really mentally stimulating, fun, and potentially financially viable. Also, I love encylcopedias. This is irrelevant with respect to the rest of what I've typed above, but true. Just figured I'd throw it into a section that is "a bit about myself". There you are.
